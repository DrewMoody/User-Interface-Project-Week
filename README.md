# User Interface Project Week

View deployed site here: https://hopeful-leavitt-1d9b87.netlify.com/

This site was built as a brief exploration of web development without a framework. Itâ€™s built with HTML, LESS (CSS preprocessor), and JavaScript (ES6). This was also one of the first sites I built with responsive design and animations (Greensock and Scrollmagic).
